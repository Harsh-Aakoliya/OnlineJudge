    deleting task mean we need to change todoList array so here filter function came into picture for an example suppose we have and array like

      if(val!="pedro") return val;
      else not return anything

    similarly here as we are taking task as an parameter so we came to know which task should not be there in new array 
    and after getting newarray we actually need to change todoList array variable by using setToddoList(newarr);

  /*
      But now here is one catch suppose we have tow same task as "Do homework" and second is also "Do homework" so till here if we press Delete button of one of the "Do homework" it will delete both of them 
      now to distinguish both task we can do one thing which is assign id to every task so now we need to modify our arr of string to arr of an object which have like
      {
        id:1
        taskName:"do homework"
      }
